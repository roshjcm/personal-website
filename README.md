# The website

The idea here was to see how to create a nice personal website. Being a newbie, I looked into the code of a template from HTML5 UP *[further credits/information at the end of the readme]*. As I was exploring the code and researching what meant what, I played a bit with it, changing some little things here and there. 

My next goal is to create my own website, this time more or less from scratch to improve my webdev skills.

### HTML5UP

This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
